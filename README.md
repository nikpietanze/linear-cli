# linear-cli

A fast, portable CLI to authenticate with Linear and read/create issues via Linear's GraphQL API. Designed for local use and CI/CD.

## Features

- Auth: login, status, and connectivity test
- Projects: list projects (name, id, status)
- Issues: list with filters, view full details, and create
  - Comments: add comments to issues
- JSON output for scripting, tabular by default
- No-delete safety: destructive operations are not implemented and blocked at transport

## Requirements

- Go 1.22 or newer
- A Linear API key (create one in Linear: Settings â†’ API)

## Installation

Option 1: Homebrew (macOS and Linux)

```bash
# Either install directly from the tap in one step:
brew install nikpietanze/tap/linear-cli

# Or add the tap explicitly, then install:
brew tap nikpietanze/tap
brew install linear-cli

# Upgrade later
brew upgrade linear-cli
```

Option 2: Download a release binary

```bash
# Go to the GitHub Releases page and download the archive for your OS/arch
# Example (macOS ARM64):
curl -L -o linear-cli.tar.gz \
  https://github.com/nikpietanze/linear-cli/releases/download/v0.1.0/linear-cli_v0.1.0_darwin_arm64.tar.gz
tar -xzf linear-cli.tar.gz
chmod +x linear-cli
mv linear-cli /usr/local/bin/linear-cli   # or somewhere on your PATH
linear-cli --help
```

Option 3: Build and install from source

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/your-org/linear-cli.git
cd linear-cli

# Build and install the binary into $GOBIN (or $GOPATH/bin)
go install .

# Ensure your Go bin is on PATH (add to your shell config if needed)
export PATH="$(go env GOPATH)/bin:$PATH"

# Verify
linear-cli --help
```

Option 4: Local build without installing globally

```bash
# From the project root
go build -o ./dist/linear-cli .
./dist/linear-cli --help
```

## Authentication

You can pass your API key via interactive login (recommended), environment, or a one-off flag.

- Recommended: run `linear-cli auth login` and paste when prompted. This stores the key in `~/.config/linear/config.toml` (0600) for use system-wide.
- Environment: set `LINEAR_API_KEY=<YOUR_TOKEN>` in your shell profile
- One-off flag: `linear-cli auth login --token <YOUR_TOKEN>`

Check status:

```bash
linear-cli auth status
```

CI health check (non-zero exit on failure):

```bash
linear-cli auth test
```

## Usage

List recent issues (optionally by team key):

```bash
linear-cli issues list --limit 10 --project "Website" --assignee "Jane" --state "In Progress"
```

Get an issue by ID or key:

```bash
linear-cli issues get --id <ISSUE_ID>
linear-cli issues get --key ENG-123
```

View full details:

```bash
linear-cli issues view <ISSUE_ID>
```

Create an issue:

```bash
linear-cli issues create --title "New bug" --description "Steps to reproduce..." --project "Website" --assignee "Jane" --label "bug" --priority 2
```

Add a comment:

```bash
linear-cli comment create --key ENG-123 --body "Ship it!"
```

List projects (requires token with read access to projects/organization):

```bash
linear-cli projects list
```

### Quick state filters

Frequently filter large lists by state using shortcuts:

```bash
# Todo
linear-cli issues list --todo
linear-cli issues todo

# In Progress
linear-cli issues list --doing
linear-cli issues doing

# Done (JSON)
linear-cli issues list --done --json
linear-cli issues done --json

# Combine with other flags
linear-cli issues doing --project "Website" --limit 20
```

You can still use the explicit state flag:

```bash
linear-cli issues list --state "In Progress"
```

## Configuration

- Env var: `LINEAR_API_KEY`
- Config file (optional): `~/.config/linear/config.toml`

Example TOML (created by `linear-cli auth login`):

```toml
api_key = "lin_xxx..."
```

The config file stores only your API key (permissions `0600`). Environment variable overrides file values.

## Uninstall

Remove the binary from your Go bin and delete the config directory:

```bash
rm -f "$(go env GOPATH)/bin/linear-cli"
rm -rf ~/.config/linear
```

## Security

This CLI intentionally does not implement delete/archive operations. At the transport layer, a guard rejects any GraphQL mutation that attempts deletion or archival, and only a small allowlist of mutations is permitted (currently: issueCreate).
